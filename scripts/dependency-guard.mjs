/**
 * Dependency guard — the wave-3 CI gate (docs/archive/contracts/00-overview.md).
 *
 * Enforces, for every package in the active workspace (packages/*):
 *
 *   1. LAYERING — the only allowed @vendoai/* edges are:
 *        core → (nothing)
 *        apps → core            automations → apps, core
 *        store, agent, actions, guard, ui → core
 *        vendo (umbrella) → everything
 *      A package not in the map fails loudly: adding a package means
 *      consciously adding its layer here.
 *
 *   2. NO QUARRY IMPORTS — nothing may import from legacy/ (path or relative
 *      escape), and nothing may import the retired package names that only
 *      exist in the quarry / on old npm (@vendoai/cli, client, components,
 *      react, runtime, server, shell, stage) — those would silently resolve
 *      to the pre-v0 published versions.
 *
 *   3. HONEST MANIFESTS — every @vendoai/* import in a package's src must be
 *      declared in its package.json (dependencies or peerDependencies).
 *      devDependencies deliberately do NOT count, while test files ARE scanned:
 *      a test-only @vendoai/* import must still be a declared, layer-legal
 *      dependency — devDeps are invisible to consumers and would let layering
 *      violations hide in tests. (Non-@vendoai devDeps like vitest are fine.)
 *
 *   4. ZOD FLOOR FOR ai PEERS — any package declaring "ai" in peerDependencies
 *      must also declare its own "zod" floor at ZOD_V4_EXPORT_FLOOR or higher.
 *      ai imports `zod/v4`; a host that pins an older zod satisfies ai's own
 *      peer range on paper (ai@6 declares "^3.25.76 || ^4.1.8") but still
 *      lacks the ./v4 subpath at runtime — zod 3.24.x has no ./v4 export,
 *      every 3.25.x patch from .0 onward does (verified empirically against
 *      the npm registry's published exports maps). pnpm then resolves the
 *      package's own low floor for a stale host lockfile entry and the
 *      host's post-init build fails with ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED
 *      ./v4 (skateshop landmine; six packages fixed in 174aa430, ui+agent
 *      missed and fixed alongside this rule).
 *
 * Runs in `pnpm lint` at the root. No dependencies; Node >= 20.
 *
 * Known residual gaps (accepted): computed dynamic imports (import(`@vendoai/${x}`))
 * and tsconfig path aliases are invisible to a static text scan; PR review covers
 * them. The scan may also match import-shaped strings inside comments — a false
 * positive fails loudly and is fixed by rewording, never by loosening the gate.
