# Contributing to Vendo

Thanks for helping make Vendo better.

## Development setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

Node 22+, pnpm 11. The repo is a turbo monorepo: `packages/` are the published
`@vendoai/*` libraries, built against the archived contracts in
`docs/archive/contracts/` (read `00-overview.md` first; layering is enforced in
`pnpm lint`). The demo host apps live under `apps/`.

## Making changes

- Branch from `main`; open a PR against `main`.
- `pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` must pass.
- UI-affecting changes need before/after screenshots in the PR.
- Keep PRs focused; small is reviewable.
